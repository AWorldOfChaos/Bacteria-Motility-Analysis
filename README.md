# Bacteria-Motility-Analysis

This project is done by me as a part of Summer Undergraduate Research Program, 2022 under Prof. Mithun Kumar Mitra of the Department of Physics and Prof. Debjani Paul of the Department of Biosciences and Bio-engineering at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to devise a pipeline which can track bacteria motions through channels. Data acquisition is images of the channel within which bacteria travel. The bacteria fluoresce due to added pigments. Image processing has been used to determine the locations of bacteria and further analyse their motion.

## Methodology
Will be updated soon

## Dataset
Please contact the concerned professors for the data. It has not been shared here since it is not open source
